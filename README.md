# Predicting-the-Survival-of-Titanic-Passengers
"Predicting Titanic Survivals" uses machine learning to forecast passenger survival on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. Analyzing passenger data and applying advanced algorithms, this project aims to unravel patterns and build a precise predictive model. Join us in exploring the factors behind survival and advancing predictive modeling.
We employ a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and gradient boosting, to build predictive models. By training on a portion of the dataset with known survival outcomes, we aim to create models capable of predicting survival for unseen passenger data accurately
